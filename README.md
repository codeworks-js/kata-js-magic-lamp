# kata-js-magic-lamp

This kata is taken from the 2019 BattleDev we've done. It was the 4th/6 exercise, so expect it to be difficult.

## Instructions

You are Aladdin, and just fell into the cave of wonders.

Well, you're quite damn happy about what you see, but the only thing you've got on yourself is your magic lamp.

You magic lamp has a limited capacity of `X`g. You can see objects (gems, carpets, gold pieces...) of a certain `weight` and a fixed `price` (for 1 object). There's also powders with a certain `quantity` in g and a `ppg` (price per g).

You must complete the function `fillTheLampToBeTheRichestManInTheWorld(maxCapacity, objects, powders)` to go out of the cave with the maximum value you can carry (well it's your lamp that's carrying it, but you'll be the richest man in the world).

## Code

In the `src` folder, you will find `index.js` with the function ready to be implemented.

## Test it

You can use `npm run test` to test your code. If all tests pass, you won !

But first intall the dependencies with `npm install`. Thanks.

## You're the richest man in the world !

That's it, there's nothing else to say.

Have fun solving this problem.
